# Frequently Asked Questions 

_**What's to stop uninvited guests joining my virtual consultation?**_ 

Each consultation takes place in a dynamically created meeting space created just for the purposes of that consultation, so there is no way for anyone else to join the consultation apart from the public user who created it, and any Office 365 users who have access to see it.

_**Is it possible to share my screen during a virtual consultation?**_ 

Not yet, but we're working on this. See our [roadmap](roadmap.md) for details.

_**Can OneConsultation record video calls?**_

Not yet, but we're working on this. See our [roadmap](roadmap.md) for details.

_**Where will the recordings be stored when this functionality is available?**_

Recordings will be stored in Azure Media Services in your tenant.

_**Are group virtual consultations possible through OneConsultation?**_

Not yet but we're working on this. See our [roadmap](roadmap.md) for details.

_**Can OneConsultation send invitations via SMS?**_

Yes, from the admin portal, an O365 user can send an SMS to a public user with a customisable message and a link to join a virtual consultation. The public user can simply click to join the video consultation straight away, which means they do not have to complete the pre-consultation questions to access the video call.
	
_**Is there extra cost associated with the SMS service?**_ 

Yes, depending on usage - this can be discussed with your Modality Systems account manager.  
	
_**Can OneConsultation send invitations via email?**_
 
No - OneConsultation is not intended to replace existing calendar management or appointment systems, and by design the product does not store any data or user information (like email addresses), so this functionality is not included on our roadmap.
  
_**Can third parties be added into a virtual consultation? For example, can a consultation take place with an O365 user, a public user, and a translator?**_

Not yet but we're working on this. See our [roadmap](roadmap.md) for details.
  
_**Can we customise the image on the public user login screen?**_

Yes, as long as the image is hosted somewhere by you, this can be whatever you like. 
  
_**Can we customise the image that a public user sees while they are waiting for their consultation to begin?**_

Not as standard - this is the default image for all users awaiting consultations. 
	
_**Can OneConsultation send a survey link after each consultation is finished?**_

Yes, this is possible using any web based survey like Microsoft Forms or SurveyMonkey. 
  
_**Can we have different post-consultation survey links for each different service/waiting room?**_

Yes, each 'service' (or waiting room) can have a different post-consultation survey link.
  
_**How is this product licenced?**_

There are no licence keys for OneConsultation. The product is licenced on a concurrent connection basis - that is, how many users are connected into virtual consultations at any one time.
	
_**What is a concurrent connection?**_

A concurrent connection is 1(one) user who is connected to a video consultation. So an in-progress consultation with one public user and one O365 user makes up 2(two) concurrent connections.
	
_**How do I know how many concurrent connections I need?**_

This will vary depending on the size and scale of your organisation and how much you'd like to use the video consultation service. Our team of experts can guide you to an appropriate estimate.
  
_**What data does OneConsultation store?**_

The system does not store any user data at rest. Public user information gathered via the pre-consultation questions is only stored in memory for the purposes of displaying in the Admin Portal, and is never persisted to an at rest service. 
	
_**Where is OneConsultation hosted?**_

OneConsultation is hosted in Microsoft Azure and therefore adheres to Microsoft security practices for access to any part of the service.
	
_**What if my organisation isn't using Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business? Can I still use OneConsultation?**_

Yes, we have a WebRTC solution to this that our Account Managers can discuss with you. 

_**What else is on the product roadmap?**_
